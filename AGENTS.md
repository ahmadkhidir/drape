# Drape — build guide

This repository is built from its specification by whichever coding agent is working in it. The rules
live with the code: this file coordinates the build, and the nearest `AGENTS.md` in a folder governs
work in that folder.

## Source of truth

The product specification in `docs/Drape/` is the single authoritative source of truth for Drape.
The specification is maintained in a dedicated documentation repository (linked at `docs/Drape/` or cloned alongside).
Requirements, user personas, screen states, data entities, and non-functional requirements in `docs/Drape/`
govern all features.

A build task never edits the specification. A gap in it becomes a `doc-gap` issue, not an assumption
and not a silent change.

### Specification modifications & subagent isolation

The specification is modified only in these situations:
1. **Unsettled requirement (`doc-gap`):** An implementation or verification task discovers an unhandled
   edge case, missing data field, ambiguous behavior, or conflicting requirement. The worker pauses, logs
   the `doc-gap` issue, and halts implementation on that path.
2. **User-directed change:** The user requests a scope adjustment, new feature addition, or requirement revision.
3. **Architectural or platform shift:** Structural, scaling, or environmental changes require updating
   `architecture.md`, `schema.md`, or `nfr.md`.

**Mandatory subagent isolation:** Spec modifications must **never** run inside an active coding or
debugging session. Mixing compiler logs, code diffs, and stack traces into specification writing
contaminates the product requirements. The coordinator dispatches a dedicated, isolated subagent
targeting `docs/` with a clean context window. That subagent loads `docs/AGENTS.md`,
aligns with the user, updates the specification under `docs/Drape/`, and commits the changes.
The implementation session resumes only after the specification is committed, reading the updated
documents as its single source of truth.

## Where truth lives

| Question | Source | How to read it |
|---|---|---|
| What to build | `docs/Drape/` | read the named document |
| Current phase | Lowest open `phase` issue | `gh issue list --label phase --state open` |
| Task scope | Issue body | `gh issue view <n>` |
| Ready work | Blocked-by links | `gh issue list --state open`, then `gh issue view <n> --json blockedBy` |
| Task status | Issue state | `gh issue view <n> --json state` |
| In flight | Pull requests | `gh pr list --state open` |
| Why a choice | `.decisions/` | `ls .decisions/`, `git log -- .decisions/` |
| Interfaces | `CONTRACTS.md` | the `C-###` entry |
| Asset paths | `ASSETS.md` | the `A-###` row |
| Area rules | nearest `AGENTS.md` | `git ls-files '*AGENTS.md'` |
| Done | this file | Definition of Done and Verification |

State that changes per task or phase lives in GitHub. Decisions that outlive a task live in this
repository. Never copy live state into a file.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Topology | Separate repositories (`docs/Drape` specification repo, application monorepo) |
| Workspace / Tooling | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo |
| Web Client (`apps/web`) | Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Three.js, WebGPU WGSL, Web Audio API |
| Core Services (`services/core`) | TypeScript (Node.js / Fastify), PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Redis, Stripe SDK, Resend SDK |
| Neural Fitting (`services/neural-fitting`) | Python 3.11+, Modal SDK, PyTorch / Diffusers, FastAPI / ASGI, pytest, Ruff |
| Database & Cache | PostgreSQL 16+, Redis 7+ |
| Testing & Verification | Vitest / React Testing Library (`apps/web`), Vitest (`services/core`), pytest (`services/neural-fitting`), Playwright E2E |

Changing a stack choice is a decision: record it in `.decisions/` and update this table.

## Area rules

Area rules live in the nearest `AGENTS.md`: any coding agent working in the area loads them.
Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` at or above the issue's `Own` paths. List them with
`git ls-files '*AGENTS.md'` or `find . -name AGENTS.md`.

Code ownership (`CODEOWNERS`) is disabled.

## Work classes

Every task is exactly one class:

- `implement` — writes product code, assets, and configuration under the issue's `Own` paths.
- `verify` — writes test files and test configuration only, under the phase gate.
- `spec` — writes only under `docs/Drape/`, governed by `docs/AGENTS.md`. Always executed in an isolated subagent.

## Build workflow

1. **Read the specification.** Resolve `docs/Drape/` and read every document at plan level:
   scope, users, features, NFRs, roadmap, architecture, data, screens, monetization, risks. The docs
   are the authority; recall is not.
2. **Adopt the roadmap.** Take its phases and their order as the build order. Do not re-sequence or
   re-group them. If the roadmap is missing or silent on order, raise a doc gap.
3. **Phase 0: Foundation.** Before any roadmap feature phase is implemented, Phase 0 (Foundation) must
   be drafted, executed, and verified. Foundation sets up:
   - Root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `apps/web/package.json`, `services/core/package.json`, and `services/neural-fitting/pyproject.toml`;
   - Verified Git and GitHub infrastructure (remote repository configured, `phase` label created, `gh` CLI operational with sub-issues and blocked-by dependencies, and default branch protection enabled);
   - Verified commands (build, test, boot, lint in scripts or Makefile);
   - CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) ensuring clean build and test runs;
   - Base test harness and verification boot check;
   - Design tokens and theme provider when visual interfaces are declared (`branding.md`);
   - Base telemetry client and event dispatcher when analytics are declared (`analytics.md`);
   - Operational and data baseline when declared: health check endpoint (`/healthz` or equivalent), structured logging, and base database connection and migration harness from `operations.md` and `schema.md`;
   - Foundational assets: generate on disk any pending core brand assets (e.g. logo, mark, favicon) defined in `ASSETS.md`;
   Roadmap feature phases (Phase 1..N) are strictly blocked by Phase 0.
4. **Confirm frozen contracts.** When interfaces exist, verify that `CONTRACTS.md` is frozen before feature tasks dispatch. Any interface modification requires an approved `change-request` issue.
5. **Draft the dispatch plan.** One phase issue for Phase 0 (Foundation) and one phase issue per roadmap
   phase from the phase template, each parented with child task issues from the task template.
   - **Declare the Phase Specification Slice:** In each phase issue, record the complete specification slice
     the phase delivers: roadmap features (`FEAT-###`), screens (`screens/*.md`), data entities (`schema.md`),
     contracts (`CONTRACTS.md` `C-###` when interfaces exist),
     telemetry events (`analytics.md` `EVT-###`), quantitative NFRs (`nfr.md`), and monetization gates (`monetization.md`).
   - **Decompose features across declared areas for parallel dispatch:** Slices features by area and frozen contract (`C-###`) so workers execute concurrently:
     - *Client & Presentation:* Tasks in client/UI areas map to screen specifications (`screens.md`) and theme tokens, wired to frozen contracts (`C-###`). For CLIs, tasks map to commands, arguments, and terminal output.
     - *Services & Data:* Tasks in backend/service areas map to contract endpoints (`CONTRACTS.md`), schema migrations (`schema.md`), and service NFRs (`nfr.md`).
     - *Model & Intelligence:* Tasks in AI areas map to model behaviors, prompt definitions, and golden-set evaluation bars.
     - *Unused surfaces:* Decompose only across surfaces the specification explicitly defines (e.g. no UI tasks for headless services).
   Every task carries `Depends on` — the issue numbers that must close first, or `none`. Tasks in different areas
   bound to a frozen contract run concurrently. Present the tree — phases, tasks, edges — and create nothing yet.
6. **Create the plan on agreement.** After the user agrees, create the `phase` label if it is missing
   (`gh label create phase`), then the phase issues in order with `gh issue create --label phase`, then
   each task with `gh issue create --parent <phase>`, then every dependency with
   `gh issue edit <n> --add-blocked-by <dep>`. Change the draft when the user asks.
7. **Ask about dispatch.** With the issues in GitHub, ask once whether to dispatch subagents or work
   them in this session. Follow Dispatch below.
8. **Gate each phase.** The gate is a `verify` task, parented to the phase and blocked by every other
   task in it. When those tasks are closed, verify the deliverable against the phase's full Specification
   Slice (contracts, acceptance criteria, screen completeness, schema migrations, telemetry events, and
   NFR budgets) and full regression suite. Close the phase issue only when the gate passes.

## Dispatch

The user decides who does the work. Once the plan exists, ask once whether to dispatch subagents or
work the issues in this session. Either answer is valid, the answer holds for the plan, and the user
can stop it at any point.

- **Draft, approve, then create.** The phase issues, the task issues, and their dependencies are a
  draft. Create them only after the user agrees, and change the draft when they ask.
- **The graph is the schedule.** A task is ready when it is in the lowest open phase and every issue
  blocking it is closed. Tasks with no edge between them may run at the same time and in any order.
  The parent phase groups its tasks; it does not order them.
- **A frozen contract is a precondition.** When interfaces exist, an issue whose `C-###` is not `Frozen` is not ready, even
  with its blockers closed.
- **Task execution.** A worker focuses on its assigned issue, reads the nearest `AGENTS.md` at or above its
  `Own` paths and the documents it names, stays within its owned paths, and reports back upon completion.
- **Tasks are leaves.** Only a phase issue has sub-issues. Never nest a task under a task.
- **A phase issue is never dispatched.** It groups its tasks and parents the gate.
- **The coordinating session works too.** When the user keeps the work here, do it under the same
  dependency rule.
- **Spec task isolation.** When dispatching a `spec` task or resolving a `doc-gap`, always run it in an
  isolated subagent targeting `docs/`. Never execute spec tasks in an active implementation
  session.
- **The phase gate.** Verify the phase with a clean test and boot sweep against the criteria before
  closing the phase issue.

## In-flight feedback and defect triage

When the user points out a defect, missing behavior, or desired change in conversation—whether during an
active phase or after earlier tasks have closed—never jump directly into editing code. Impromptu edits bypass
verification, violate path boundaries, and create fragmented issue churn.

Follow this triage protocol:

1. **Inspect and trace first.** Before proposing a fix or opening an issue, inspect the relevant codebase,
   test suites, and specification. Identify the true root cause and trace all affected surfaces (client UI states,
   service endpoints, data models, contracts when present).
2. **Conduct a diagnostic interview.** Ask targeted, clarifying questions to establish complete intent:
   - Determine whether the feedback reflects an implementation bug against the existing specification or an
     intentional shift in product requirements.
   - Clarify edge-case behavior and inquire whether adjacent screens, commands, or workflows should follow
     the same pattern.
3. **Consolidate and propose the scope.** Synthesize the findings into a clear diagnosis. Present a single,
   comprehensive plan to the user rather than opening fragmented, symptom-by-symptom issues.
4. **Contract-first execution:**
   - For defects or implementation gaps against existing requirements: draft a `Class: fix` task parented
     to the active phase issue, establish exact `Own` boundaries, confirm with the user, create the issue,
     and dispatch.
   - For requirement shifts or new features: dispatch an isolated subagent under `docs/AGENTS.md`
     to update the specification under `docs/Drape/` first, commit it separately, and then draft the
     implementation task(s).
   - For interface or data schema changes (when contracts exist): file a `change-request` issue to revise `CONTRACTS.md` before
     updating application code.

## Task contract

Every task is an issue from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`, parented to its phase issue, with:

- `Class` — implement, fix, verify, spec, or chore.
- `Own` — the paths the task may write; everything outside `Own` is read-only. The nearest `AGENTS.md` at or above `Own` governs the work.
- `Depends on` — the issue numbers that must close first, or `none`. The issue's blocked-by links
  mirror this line; when they disagree, the issue body is the record and the coordinator fixes the
  links.
- `Contract` — the `C-###` it implements, or `none`.
- `Specification` — the specific feature (`FEAT-###`), screens, schema entities, telemetry events (`EVT-###`), or NFRs assigned to this task.
- `Criteria` — where the acceptance criteria live (e.g. from `features/FEAT-###.md`, screens, or contracts).

A task closes when its PR merges and the issue closes. There is no route file and no separate
delivery board.

## Contracts

`CONTRACTS.md` holds one entry per interface. `Frozen` means both sides agree; `Implemented` means it
shipped and conforms. A change after `Frozen` is a `change-request` issue and a PR that updates both
sides. Never deviate silently.

## Definition of Done

A task is done when:

- its unit tests pass;
- it conforms to the frozen contract;
- only its owned paths changed;
- all states and specifications assigned to its area are fully implemented;
- no placeholder, stub, or `TODO` remains;
- the build and boot still work;
- user-facing copy reads as human-written.

A phase is done when its gate task passes and the phase issue closes.

## Verification

A phase is verified after all its tasks are done.

Inputs: the phase's tasks, `CONTRACTS.md` (when present), the acceptance criteria
those issues name, the parent phase's Specification Slice, the quality bar in `nfr.md`, and the commands in this file.

1. Build the deliverable the way it ships and boot it. A green suite is not proof it runs; the build
   and the boot are. On failure, report the log.
2. Run the full suite, not the slice.
3. Write the integration, end-to-end, and acceptance tests the criteria require. Unit tests belong to
   the implementers; do not duplicate them.
4. Verify behavior against the criteria and contracts (not pixels).
5. Verify screen completeness: when visual interfaces are declared, confirm that all declared screen states (empty, loading, error, submitting,
   success) are implemented and functional rather than stubbed.
6. Verify telemetry: when analytics are declared, confirm that declared events (`EVT-###`) fire with schema-valid payloads during user flows.
7. Verify quantitative NFRs: test password hashing standards, session TTLs, rate limits, and latency budgets from `nfr.md`.
8. When the product has model-backed behavior, run the golden set against the pinned model, compute
   the metric, and compare it to `NFR-###`. Report the metric, sample size, pass rate, and failing
   cases.
9. Treat placeholders, stubs, `TODO`s, and "just for now" shortcuts as Definition-of-Done failures.
10. Report each failure with file/line and expected vs actual. Never fix it.

Write only test files and test configuration; feature code is read-only. Never tune a threshold or
the evaluation set to make a run pass. Never disable the build check to reach a green gate. If a
requirement has no acceptance criterion, report a doc gap; do not invent the test. Do not judge
appearance; that belongs to the frontend.

## Git and GitHub

- `main` is protected. Work on a short-lived branch and open a PR.
- Conventional Commits. Commits link the spec and the issue: e.g. `Implements: FEAT-###` and `Fixes #<n>`.
- Commit only the paths the issue owns. Never `git add -A`.
- A PR carries the issue number, the `C-###` it conforms to (when contracts exist), and the checks run.
- A phase issue closes only after its gate task passes.
- Sub-issues and dependencies need GitHub CLI 2.94.0 or newer: `--parent`, `--add-sub-issue`, and
  `--blocked-by`.
- When `docs/` is a separate repository or Git submodule, specification changes and doc-gap resolutions are committed directly in the documentation repository; pointer updates in this repository are managed via dedicated PRs.

## Decisions

`.decisions/ADR-###-<slug>.md`, one decision per file, append-only. A decision records the choice,
the reason, and the consequences. Supersede a decision with a new file; never rewrite an accepted
one.

## Boundaries

- Never write under the specification path from an implementation task.
- Never invent a requirement. A missing answer is a doc gap.
- Never log or commit secrets, tokens, or unmasked identity.
- Never tune a test, threshold, or evaluation set to make a run pass.
- Never add a markdown document where inline documentation is enough.
- In durable code comments and tests, cite permanent spec anchors (`FEAT-###`, `NFR-###`, `EVT-###`, or `C-###` when contracts exist). Commits and PRs link the spec and the GitHub issue.
